World Event: Spawn Portal

1. This world event is triggered by left clicking the screen where you would like to spawn a portal to an evil dimension.

2. When the event is triggered, a portal will spawn. The portal is a wormhole, but enemies cannot exit the wormhole until steps surrounding the wormhole are created. These are classy beings which are simply looking for a new world to rule; they aren't savages.

3. When the event is triggered, two evil new entities will appear, the Wyvern and the Wyvern care taker. The Wyvern is a mystic reptilian bird like beast which attacks all entities of the regular world except Ore Blobs which they have some fondness for. The Wyvern care taker is a healer type that heals the Wyvern when it is damaged. It strangely resembles Squidward for some reason.

4. When the portals, Wyverns, and Wyvern healers are spawned, miners will avoid these points to prevent being attacked and Blacksmith will arm themseleves with their swords and transform into ninjas. These ninjas will then seekout nearby Wyverns and healers until they are all out of sight. At that point, the ninjas will turn back into Blacksmiths and begin collecting ore again.
